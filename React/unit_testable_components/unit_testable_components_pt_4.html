        Testing actions within actions
    </h3>
    <p>
        It's very length, and sometimes difficult, but it doesn't matter where you do it. It will always be challenging. The difference here is that
        <code>
            enzyme
        </code>
        and
        <code>
            shallow
        </code>
        mocking of the DOM has nothing to do with these tests. Here is what a sample test would look like

// middleware to be passed into mocked store
import thunk from 'redux-thunk'

import configureStore from 'redux-mock-store'

    getPopularSearches,
    getNews,

// mock the functions so I can use returnValueOnce
jest.mock('Api/ApiCalls/HomeApi/HomeApi')

getPopularSearches.returnValueOnce(popularsearchesPayload)

// setting up my mock store that dispatches actions and keeps track of emitted actions

        There you have it. Test Redux and React components in its own encapsulated environments. Independently use
        <code>
            enzyme
        </code>
        to test components and
        <code>
            redux-mock-store
        </code>
        for your business logic. Not both at once.
