            My approach to component testing
        </h3>
        <p>
            There are multiple resources that show how to test components. When you read between the lines, they are actually describing their philosophy on how a component should be tested.

        <h3>
            My tests are basic and practical because my components are dumb
        </h3>
        <p>
            My components have the following properties
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                No api calls
            </li>
            <li>
                Small encapsulated components
            </li>
            <li>
                Minimal Redux actions
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As a consequence, my tests have the following principles
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Shallow mount component directly. Ignore Redux's
                <code>
                    connect
                </code>
                higher order function (HOF) in test
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>
                    simulate
                </code>
                interaction of ui elements and assert internal behavior of the event handler
            </li>
            <li>
                Use
                <code>
                    setProps
                </code>
                to change props (even redux store props), because I exclude the
                <code>
                    connect
                </code>
                HOF
            </li>
            <li>
                Indirectly test usage of
                <code>
                    setState
                </code>
                by asserting value changes in
                <code>
                    this.state
                </code>
            </li>

            Shallow mount component directly

        <p>
            A consequence of my practical approach to unit testing.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Mounting with HOFs greatly increases complexity and does not provide substantial benefits
        </h4>
        <p>
            Incorporating HOFs into your unit tests makes them more finnicky and extremely verbose. From a technical perspective, including HOFs is more reflective of runtime behavior. But what exactly are you <i>testing</i> by doing so? What else is there aside from confirming that
            <code>
                connect
            </code>
            works? I don't see value in the huge complexity jump that HOFs add when it comes to unit testing.

            Assert interntal behavior of an event handler callback. Not the callback itself
        </h3>
        <h4>
            You don't need spies if you do it this way
        </h4>
        <p>
            Having the event handler method run is not important. What <i>is</i> important is the internal behavior. If you
            <code>
                simulate
            </code>
            user input and it runs everything inside your handler method, doesn't that already imply the event handler was run?
        </p>
        <h4>
            Using
            <code>
                jest.fn
            </code>
            to mock functions is easy
        </h4>
        <p>
            Once you get into the testing groove, it is quick and concise to create mocks.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
// component file: button's click handler
handleLogOut = () => {
    this.props.destroyLogOutUser()
}

// test file
const destroyLogOutUser = jest.fn()
const wrapper = shallow(&ltLogOut destroyLogOutUser={destroyLogOutUser}/&gt)
describe('component', () => {
    it('logs user out when clicked', () => {
        const menuItem = wrapper.find(MenuItem)
        menuItem.simulate('click')
        expect(destroyLogOutUser).toHaveBeenCalled()
    })
})
            </code>
        </pre>

            Use
            <code>
                setProps
            </code>
            for all props. Even Redux store props
        </h3>
        <h4>
            Mocks behavior, but Redux store data is coming from an improper source
        </h4>
        <p>
            A consequence of directly testing the dumb component. I can see merit to anyone who takes issues to this concept. As said before, I do this because it is practical. Ultimately, it is still mocking the data that is necessary to test functionality.

            Test consequences of the function calling
            <code>
                setState
            </code>
            instead of spying it
        </h3>
        <h4>
            You can only assert function calls for spies and mocks, which is a bad thing for
            <code>
                setState
            </code>
        </h4>
        <p>
            You destroy the behavior of
            <code>
                setState
            </code>
            in order to check if it has been called. But how can you have the function perform its operation if it has been mocked? A catch 20/20. Instead, keep
            <code>
                setState
            </code>
            intact and test how
            <code>
                this.state
            </code>
            changes after the function is run. You are indirectly testing to see if the call to
            <code>
                setState
            </code>
            has the expected behavior
            <pre>
                <code>
// component click handler
openMenu = () => this.setState({ openMenu: true })

// test
it('opens the menu when clicked', () => {
    const dropdownButton = wrapper.find('button')
    dropdownButton.simulate('click')
    expect(wrapper.instance().state.openMenu).toEqual(true)
})
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
