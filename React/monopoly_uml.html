  After building so many projects, I decided to look into
  good practices. This means things like cleaner code and unit
  testing. For
  funsies, I decided to look into building UMLs for my project.
  Much to nobody's surprise but mine, it actually helped.

  A well structured overview of your component
  and class hierarchy helped me see where my
  inefficiencies and needed abstractions that
  were in my code. Certain things should be
  their own containers, methods should be abstracted out,
  and all this other good stuff.
</p>

<p>
  Some of the things I saw that should've been fixed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  My prompts should be in their own container.
    Not a direction connection to the board center
    component
</li>
<li>
  My turn class makes more sense if it has a die, as
  opposed to my player class have a die.
</li>
</ul>
