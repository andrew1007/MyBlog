        <p>
            Testing UI behavior is really hard, and you can get lulled into writing sloppy tests. Sloppy tests are
            unmaintainable and encourage "behavior locking". It's a problem that only grows as time goes on

            Testing React components is hard
        </h3>
        <p>
            Frontend testing requires, in one form or another, a mocked DOM, which is a beast in its own rite. Your
            tests can't be run like a basic function, because the true test behavior is browser-dependent. Which is what
            <a>
                enzyme
            </a>
            was created for. It's a mandatory supplement to
            <a>
                jest
            </a>
            for component testing.

            Spaghetti is easy to right, but hard to test and maintain. Large components also hurt performance, for
            reasons that can be dove into on another day. Here are the qualities that I value when I design components.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Small components that represent a singular idea
            </li>
            <li>
                Few or no props passed in from parent (flux implementation needed)
            </li>
            <li>
                Minimal business logic
            </li>

            When you do things the right way, everything just "falls right into place"
        </h3>
        <p>
            These principles that I value make code clean, maintainable, and implies separation of concerns (which
            vanilla React does a bad job of). Deep dependencies between UI elements and their behavior inside a
            component is the pain point when it comes to testing

            Redux gives us a ecosystem to create separation of concerns
        </h3>
        <p>
            The interface between Redux and React components leverage the DOM, but Redux itself does not. It is its own
            data flow ecosystem. Redux is the perfect place to abstract out complex behavior, so your component tests
            don't have to worry about handling it.
