I love using the spread operator to clean up my
prop passing when working with React, which I always
placed in my render function.

render() {
  const componentProps = {dog: 'dog', cat: 'cat'}
  return (
    <div>
      <MyComponent {...componentProps}/>
    </div>
  )
}

One level of abstraction for prop passing.
But we can go deeper. One more level of abstraction.

Why

I found myself writing a component with 7 children,
all of which needed props. I was declaring my props,
as normal, in my render function. But it ended up
being 30 lines of code before I even returned anything.

I had a solution

Make an entirely new function and create all your props
there.

get childComponentProps() {
  componentProps = {dog: 'dog', cat: 'cat'}
  return { componentProps };
}

render() {
  const { componentProps } = this.childComponentProps;
  return (
    <div>
      <MyComponent {...componentProps}/>
    </div>
  )
}

My render function with 7 components went from 50
collective lines down to 2 lines of prop creation lines
before the return statement.
