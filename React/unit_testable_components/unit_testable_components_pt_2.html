            Use global state management, like Redux
        </h3>
        <p>
            Production size codebases are completely unmaintainable if local component state is exclusively used. Don't even try. React +16.3 introduced their own global state management system, the
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html" target="_blank">
                context api.
            </a>
            But even then, I find it to be lacking base functionality. If you want those niceties, I don't you should reinvent the wheel when 
            <a href="https://react-redux.js.org/" target="_blank">
                redux
            </a>
            is so functionality-rich with a huge open source community that backs it. I use the features you get from redux to keep my components virtually free of business logic.

            Opinion: Thunk is the only Redux middleware needed
        </h3>
        <p>
            There is a lot of middleware out there, but I find
            <a>
                thunk
            </a>
            to be more than adequate for my needs.

            Actions within actions: abstracting and minimizing business logic in components
        </h3>
        <p>
            Run one action inside the component, and have the action perform many operations inside it.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-javascript">
export class Home extends React.Component {
    static whyDidYouRender: boolean

    componentDidMount() {
        this.props.processHomeMount()
    }

    render() {
        return (
            &ltdiv&gt
                &ltShowOfTheDay /&gt
                &ltPopularSearches /&gt

    const mapDispatchToProps = { processHomeMount }

    export default connect(
        () => ({}), mapDispatchToProps
    )(Home)
}

        </pre>
        <p>
            That's it. But what does the redux action 
            <code>
                processHomeMount
            </code>
            do?
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
const processHomeMount: types.processHomeMount = () =>
    async (dispatch, getState) => {
        try {
            const type = getState().home.topSearches.focusedDateRange
            const { endDate, startDate } = createPresentDateRange({ daysAgo: 100 })
            dispatch(fetchPopularSearches({ type, limit: TOP_SEARCH_ENTRY_COUNT })),
            dispatch(fetchNews({ startDate, endDate }))
        } catch (error) {
            throw new Error(error)
        }
    }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <ul>
            <li>
                gets a value from Redux store
            </li>
            <li>
                creates two sets of dates to be used as params in one of the api calls
            </li>
            <li>
                dispatches two actions that make API calls with a lot of business logic inside each
            </li>
            <li>
                try/catch error handling
            </li>
        </ul>
        The two inner actions
        <code>
            fetchPopularSearches
        </code>
        and
        <code>
            fetchNews
        </code>
        are entirely different beasts on their own that also contain api calls and algorithmic logic as well
