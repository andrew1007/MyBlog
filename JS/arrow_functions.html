  <p>
    An unintuitive concept, but these are fundamentally different
  </p>

  <pre class="language-javascript">
    <code>
&ltbutton onClick={this.runFunction} /&gt //NOT THE SAME
&ltbutton onClick={() => this.runFunction()}/&gt
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    Try it out yourself later in a component, where
    <code>this.runFunction</code> uses <code>this.setState</code>. The first will
    throw an error. The other will not. Theres a short explanation and a long one.
    To someone who has no idea why these two are different, I think a long explanation
    is in order.

  <h2>
    <code>function</code> and its <code>this</code> play by its own rules
  </h2>

  <p>
    The definition of context in a <code>function</code> does not obey lexical
    scoping unless you tell it to. If you give it no declarations, it assumes
    <code>this</code> is the window object.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Strict declaration of context
  </h2>

  <pre class="language-javascript">
    <code>
this.myFunction // 'this' is my context, where my 'this' resulting declaration will obey lexical scoping

function ConstructorExample() {

  this.testAnonThis = function() { //this.testThis binds this function to my constructor's context
    let anonThis = (function(){
      return this
    })() //anonymous function. THIS HAS NO BINDING. Remember, not lexically scoped.
    console.log(`anonThis is the window object?: ${window === anonThis}`)
  }
}
new ConstructorExample().testAnonThis()
//anonThis is the window object?: true
    </code>
  </pre>

  <h2>
    Why do <code>function</code>-based anonymous functions have <code>this === window</code>?
  </h2>

  <p>
    JavaScript assigns context very late. As mentioned before, the assignment of this in an
    anonymous function does not obey lexical scoping.
    Some see it as a strength, because you can
    reuse functions and keep things lean, while others call it unintuitive and flawed
    by design.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Arrow functions have no <code>this</code>
  </h2>

  <p>
    So important to understand, that it hurts. I need to explicitly state it:
  </p>

  <quote>
    functions assigned using <code>function</code> have a context automatically assigned: (<code>this</code>).
    Arrow function do not have a <code>this</code>
  </quote>

  <h2>
    So how does this apply to React.js?
  </h2>

  <p>
    10 years later, I'm going to explain that original statement.
  </p>

  <pre class="language-javascript"><code>&ltbutton onClick={this.runFunction}/&gt</code></pre>
  This is assigned using <code>function</code>, which has its own context.

  <pre class="language-javascript">
      <code>&ltbutton onClick={()=> this.runFunction()}/&gt</code>
    </pre>
  Assigned as an arrow function, which has a <code>this</code> that is
  inherited from the React component class.

  <h2>
    My personal opinion: Just use arrow functions, all the time.
  </h2>

  <p>
    It's important to understand fundamentals. But at the end of the day, the
    ECMAScript team introduced arrow functions for a very good reason: They
    make so much sense.
  </p>

  <p>
    In fact, they make sense to the point where you don't even have to know what's
    going on to use them flawlessly. In my opinion: an incredible strength, but a minor
    detriment. The future will consist of developers that don't understand fundamentals,
    such as myself, from 3 months ago. But you will never run into context issues if your
    event handlers are arrow functions.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Yes, I know I didn't explain how to fix the <code>function</code>-based assignment
  </h2>

  <p>
    Brainless answer: use bind.
  </p>

  <pre class="language-javascript"><code>&ltbutton onClick={this.runFunction.bind(this)}/&gt //proper scope</code></pre>

  <p>
    If I somehow not been talking to myself for the past 7 blog posts and any viewers want to understand
    this topic, feel free to
    leave me a comment and I'll go over bind, call, and apply.
