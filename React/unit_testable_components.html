            This code should be changed, but that would mean I have to update my tests...

            Testing UI behavior is really hard, and you can get lulled into writing sloppy tests. Sloppy tests are
            unmaintainable and encourage "behavior locking". It's a problem that only grows as time goes on

            Frontend testing requires, in one form or another, a mocked DOM, which is a beast in its own rite. Your tests can't be run like a basic function, because the true test behavior is browser-based. Which is what
            <a>
                enzyme
            </a>
            was created for. It's a mandatory supplement to
            <a>
                jest
            </a>
            for component testing.
