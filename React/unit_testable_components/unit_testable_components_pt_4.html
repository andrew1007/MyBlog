    <h3>
        Testing actions within actions
    </h3>
    <p>
        Testing actions is length, and sometimes difficult, but it doesn't matter where you do it. It will always be
        challenging. The difference here is that the DOM is irrelevant for these tests. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I use
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-mock-store" target="_blank">
            redux-mock-store
        </a>
        to test my actions. No need for
        <a href="https://airbnb.io/enzyme/" target="_blank">
            enzyme.
        </a>
        One less moving part to deal with. Here is what a sample test would look like

            There you have it. Test Redux and React components in their own respective environments. Independently use
            <code>
            enzyme
        </code>
            to test components and
            <code>
            redux-mock-store
        </code>
            for your business logic. Not both at once.
