<p>
  let and const are a breath of fresh air in almost all cases. But now
  that you understand the difference between declaration and initialization,
  because you religously follow my blog (of course), something like this,
  in its own bizzare way, makes sense.
</p>

<code>
  function scopeDeclarationTest() {
    let i = 'outer declaration'
    if (true) {
      console.log(i)
      i = 'an inner assignment'
    }
    if (true) {
      console.log(i)
      let i = 'inner delcaration'
    }
  }
</code>

<p>
  This code will break.
</p>

<h2>
  Let's break it down, by line:
</h2>

<code>
  let i = 'outer declaration'
</code>

<p>
  "This code exists in the outermost block scope(which happens to be the function scope). "
  "It is declared, initialized, and is available to any scopes nested inside it. So"
  "why does it break?"
</p>

<h2>
  Declaration (hoisting) is still at the top of the scope it exists in
</h2>



<code>
  /*declare i but not initialized*/
</code>
